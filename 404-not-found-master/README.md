You can find the demo of the project hosted at Vercel (https://vercel.com/), this project personally helped me to resume web development, since I had left it on pause for work reasons; I was able to notice that I remember certain HTML and CSS elements

### Built With

The project was built entirely with HTML and CSS, the only external file used was normalize.css (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build and imitate the 404 error page, to indicate to the user that the page they wanted to find cannot be found.


## Acknowledgements

I completed the project thanks to the courses given by Juan Pablo Torres, an excellent teacher
